/*03. Sequence in matrix
Description
We are given a matrix of strings of size N x M. Sequences in the matrix we define as sets of several neighbour elements located on the same line, column or diagonal. Write a program that finds the longest sequence of equal strings in the matrix and prints its length.

Input
On the first line you will receive the numbers N and M separated by a single space
On the next N lines there will be M strings separated with spaces - the strings in the matrix

Output
Print the length of the longest sequence of equal equal strings in the matrix

Constraints
3 <= N, M <= 128
